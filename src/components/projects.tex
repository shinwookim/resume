    \textbf{GRASP-HPO: Hyperparameter Optimization using Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure.}\\
    {Working with Dr. Daniel Mosse and Dr. Silvio Quincozes, created a novel algorithm for hyperparameter optimization for use in various Machine Learning applications such as in XGBoost. After implementing, created benchmarks of GRASP-HPO by comparing it to other HPO algorithms in a real-world scenario of intrusion detection systems (IDS).}

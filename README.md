# Résumé for Shinwoo Kim
This repository contains the contents and styling for my résumé. The source content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is processed and compiled into $\LaTeX$, and eventually into a PDF.

The styling is based on Trey Hunner's [template](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume), although I've modified it a little bit.

The template is originally by Trey Hunner, who relased it under the [MIT License](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume/blob/master/LICENSE); my modifications are released under the same license.
